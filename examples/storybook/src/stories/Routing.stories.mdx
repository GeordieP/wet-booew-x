# Routing

Because `wet-boew-react` uses CDTS under the hood, many of the templates will
generate traditional anchor links like `<a href="/path">Link</a>`. These links will
cause the browser to perform a full page reload whenever they are clicked and
will cause any client-side application state to be lost. This is not ideal.

In modern React applications we tend to want to use a client-side routing
library like [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).
To accomplish this, `wet-boew-react` includes an `onAnchorClick` prop on the
`<WetProvider>` component.
