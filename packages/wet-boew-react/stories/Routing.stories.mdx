# Routing

Because `wet-boew-react` uses [CDTS](https://cenw-wscoe.github.io/sgdc-cdts/docs/index-en.html) under the hood, many of the templates will
generate traditional anchor links like `<a href="/path">Link</a>`. These links will
cause the browser to perform a full page reload whenever they are clicked and
will cause any client-side application state to be lost. This is not ideal.

In modern React applications we tend to want to use a client-side routing
library like [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).
To accomplish this, `wet-boew-react` includes a `linkHandler` prop on the
`<WetProvider>` component.

```jsx
<WetProvider language={currentLanguage} linkHandler={handleLink}>
```

## React Router Example

```jsx
import { useLocation, useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { useLanguage } from "../src";

const { currentLanguage } = useLanguage(useLocation());
const history = useHistory();
const handleLink = useCallback(
  (a) => {
    history.push(a.href.replace(window.location.origin, ""));
  },
  [history]
);
```

## NextJS example

**Note:** With the linkHandler in place, there is no need to use the
NextJS `<Link>` element. In fact `<Link>` should be avoided as it may lead to
unexpected behaviour.

```jsx
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const router = useRouter();
const currentLanguage = router.locale?.split("-")[0] ?? "en";
const handleLink = useCallback(
  (a: HTMLAnchorElement) => {
    const relativeUrl = a.href.replace(window.location.origin, "");
    const asUrl = `/${currentLanguage}${relativeUrl}`;
    router.push(relativeUrl, asUrl, {
      shallow: false,
      locale: router.locale,
    });
  },
  [router, currentLanguage]
);
```
