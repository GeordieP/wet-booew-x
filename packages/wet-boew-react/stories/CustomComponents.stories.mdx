# Custom Components

The components included with WBR strive to implement the standard WET library of
components strictly according to the [WET style guide](https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/index-en.html).
However, there may be times when you need to implement a component that is not
included in WET or implement a slight variation on an existing WET component.
In these cases, you can create your own custom components.

WBR injects all the WET CSS in your application via the `<WetProvider>` so
you can use any of the WET CSS classes in your custom components. You can also take
advantage of the WET JavaScript although it may be preferable to do things in a
more react-fiendly way rather than leaning on the outdated jQuery approach of the
WET JavaScript.

A word of caution, WET works hard to be as accessibility friendly as possible.
When customizing or building your own components, accessibility is your responsibility.
